- ReportIt is made for users to report incidents near their location in real time.

- It helps others using the app to avoid certain areas where accidents may have occurred.

- Users can pin an incident by searching for your location in the search bar, or using your current location (you need to enable this in your browser).

- Then, click on the map where you would like to drop a pin, and add a description of the incident.

- If you need to update the description, please click on the pin again, and update the description.

- Thanks for using ReportIt!
