# ReportIt

![report it](/app-img.png)

- ReportIt is made for users to report incidents near their location in real time.
- It helps others using the app to avoid certain areas where accidents may have occurred.
- Users can pin an incident by searching for your location in the search bar, or using your current location (you need to enable this in your browser). The app will default to Melbourne, AUS as the center if no location is specified. 
- Then, click on the map where you would like to drop a pin, and add a description of the incident.
- If you need to update the description, please click on the pin again, and update the description.
- If you'd like to view listed incidents, navigate to the incidents tab. 
- Thanks for using ReportIt!

### Stretch goals 

- Ideally I would've liked to create a backend so accidents are saved to a database, and are stored when the session is closed. I would've liked to do this in node/express. 
- I would have also liked to have a sign up/log in functionality, so that it is recorded which user reported the accident.
- Would've also liked to store all of the updates made to an incident. 
- Implemented a delete function so that the marker can be cleared once the incident has been resolved.
